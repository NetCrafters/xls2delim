Description:
      This is a quick and simple command line utility to convert an Excel spreadsheet
      to a delimited file. It's basically just a wrapper for the Spreadsheet::ParseExcel
      perl module. That module is required to run this script.

      xls2delim [options] filename
          where 'filename' is the Excel spreadsheet file to read.

Options:
      --output-file
          File name to save the delimited text output to, otherwise output goes
          to STDOUT.

      --delimiter
          Character(s) to use as the delimiter between fields. Default is pipe.
          
      --line-ending
          Character(s) to use at the end of each row. Default is a single line feed.

      --worksheet-name
          Use this specify a particular worksheet name within the workbook. Takes
          precedence over the --worksheet-number option.

      --worksheet-number
          Use this specify a particular worksheet within the workbook by the order
          in which it appears. Default is 0, the first worksheet.

      --row-min --row-max --col-min --col-max
          Set the cell boundaries to be used when reading the worksheet. Defaults to
          the top left (row 0, col 0) to the last row and column detected in the worksheet.

      --help

Examples:
      Print all cells in the first worksheet in the file.xls spreadsheet to
      standard output (screen) using all default options.

      Use a worksheet named Worksheet5, tab delimiter, carriage return and line feed line
      endings, start at row 3 column 2, and save the output to a file named newfile.txt.
